## 1. Personalize the 3D Model

### Steps:
1. Visit [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com) and log in or create an account.
2. Search for the project models from the provided list.
3. Make a copy of the model using the **Make a Copy** button.
4. Modify the parametric design:
   - Adjust the `FOREARM LENGTH` and `FOREARM WIDTH` variables by double-clicking them in the left sidebar.
   - Insert personalized values in millimeters and confirm changes.
5. Review all components to ensure proper customization of dimensions.

### Export:
1. Right-click the **EXPORT 1** component in the taskbar.
2. Export settings:
   - **Format**: STL  
   - **Units**: Millimeters  
   - **Resolution**: Fine  
   - Check "Export parts as individual files."
3. Save the components as individual files for 3D printing.

## 2. Produce the Components with a 3D Printer

### Technology:
- Use an FDM 3D printer or consult a local or online 3D printing service.
- Alternative: SLS technology for maximum durability (increased cost, limited color options, and additional finishing requirements).

### Material:
- Polyamide is recommended for its affordability and durability.
- Select preferred color options as desired.

### Printing Position:
- Arrange the components on the printing plane as shown in the provided illustrations for optimal results.
